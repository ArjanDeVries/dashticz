Release Notes
=============
A link to the release notes will be posted in the Dashticz support forum. The total overview can be found below.

2.5.6 and 2.5.7
---------------

* Graph improvements. See :ref:`dom_graphs` for usage description. 

  * Selection of values you want to show in a graph via the graphTypes parameter. See :ref:`dom_blockparameters`.
  * Support for the ``title`` and ``width`` parameter in a graph block.

* Additional mechanism to prevent caching of images in a button via the ``forcerefresh`` parameter. See :ref:`forcerefresh`.

* Change background color for active 'slide' button. See :ref:`slidebutton`.

* Flash on change. See  :ref:`Flashonchange`.
  
  If you have defined the flash parameter for a device-block, then the block will flash on change.
  The formatting of the flash can be modified via the class ``.blockchange`` in your ``custom.css``.

  The parameter ``config['blink_color']`` is (temporarily?) not used anymore.
  (reason: the apply background mechanism didn't work for non-touch devices)

* Improved layout of blinds
* Update of Romanian language
* Update to FontAwesome 5.7.2
* Fix for some RFX meters (incl. water meter)
