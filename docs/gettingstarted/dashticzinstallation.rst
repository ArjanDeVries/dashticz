Dashticz Installation 
---------------------------
Example for Raspberry PI running Apache web server:
Assumption:

* Apache is running at ``http://192.168.1.3`` on the default port 80 (but this can be any IP:port address)
* Domoticz is running at ``http://192.168.1.3:8084``

First clone the dashticz repository to a folder of your choice:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /home/pi
    git clone https://github.com/dashticzv3/dashticz_v3 --branch beta

After the installation is finished, go to the ``/home/pi/dashticz_v3/custom/`` folder, copy the CONFIG_DEFAULT.js file to CONFIG.js (mind the CAPITALS!), and edit it with the basics:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd dashticz_v3/custom/
    cp CONFIG_DEFAULT.js CONFIG.js
    nano CONFIG.js

Example of CONFIG.js:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var config = {}
    config['language'] = 'nl_NL'; //or: en_US, de_DE, fr_FR, hu_HU, it_IT, pt_PT, sv_SV
    config['domoticz_ip'] = 'http://192.168.1.3:8084';
    config['domoticz_refresh'] = '5';
    config['dashticz_refresh'] = '60';

You can read more about the connection configurtion :ref:`config-connection`.

Then create a symbolic link from the root of the www folder of your web server to the previously created Dashticz location::

  sudo ln -s /home/pi/dashticz_v3/ /var/www/html

Set the correct permissions to the files and folders::

  chmod -R a+rX /home/pi/dashticz_v3

If you want to be able to save the settings via Dashticz to CONFIG.js then you have to give write permission to CONFIG.js for root::

  chmod a+w /home/pi/dashticz_v3/custom/CONFIG.js

Now you can browse to the dashboard: http://192.168.1.3/dashticz_v3/index.html
Replace 192.168.1.3 with the IP Address (and Port number) for your web server, NOT your Domoticz IP!

By default, Dashticz will show all your Domoticz favorites on the dashboard.
